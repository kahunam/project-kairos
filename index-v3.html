        <h1>1. Set Up a Logical Site Structure</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it's important for SEO:</strong> A logical site structure
          helps search engines understand and index your content more
          effectively. It also improves user experience, which can lead to
          better engagement metrics and potentially higher rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to get started yourself:</strong> Use Shopify's built-in
          navigation and collection features to organise your products into
          categories and subcategories. Ensure your main navigation menu
          reflects your site structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Working with a developer:</strong> A developer can help create
          custom navigation solutions, implement breadcrumbs, and ensure proper
          internal linking throughout your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of using a developer:</strong> They can create more
          complex hierarchies and custom solutions that may not be possible with
          Shopify's default tools, potentially improving both SEO and user
          experience.

        <h1>2. Customise Your Store's URL</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it's important for SEO:</strong> A custom URL that
          includes your brand name is more memorable and professional, which can
          indirectly benefit SEO by increasing direct traffic and brand
          searches.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to get started yourself:</strong> Use Shopify's built-in
          domain settings to change your URL. This is a straightforward process
          that most users can handle without developer assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Working with a developer:</strong> Generally not necessary for
          this task, as Shopify provides user-friendly tools for URL
          customization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of using a developer:</strong> Not applicable for
          this task; Shopify's built-in tools are sufficient.

        <p>
          <strong>Why it's important for SEO:</strong> Page speed is a ranking
          factor for search engines and significantly impacts user experience,
          which can affect engagement metrics and conversions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to get started yourself:</strong> Use Shopify's built-in
          image compression, minimise apps, and choose a fast, responsive theme.
          Run speed tests using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Working with a developer:</strong> A developer can optimise
          code, implement advanced caching techniques, and fine-tune server
          responses for better performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of using a developer:</strong> They can achieve
          more significant speed improvements through technical optimizations
          that go beyond Shopify's built-in tools.

          keyword tracking tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of using a developer:</strong> Minimal for this
          task; keyword research is primarily a strategic rather than technical
          task.

          <strong>How to get started yourself:</strong> Create valuable content

        <p>
          <strong>Why it's important for SEO:</strong> SEO apps can automate and
          simplify many optimization tasks, helping you improve your store's SEO
          more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to get started yourself:</strong> Browse the Shopify App
          Store for highly-rated SEO apps. Start with apps that cover areas
          where you need the most help.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Working with a developer:</strong> A developer can help
          integrate apps more seamlessly with your store and customise their
          functionality if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages of using a developer:</strong> They can ensure apps
          work well with your specific store setup and can create custom
          solutions if existing apps don't meet your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, while many of these tasks can be started on your own using
          Shopify's built-in tools, working with a developer can often take your
          SEO efforts to the next level, especially for larger or more complex
          stores. The key is to balance DIY efforts with professional help where
          it can make the most impact.
